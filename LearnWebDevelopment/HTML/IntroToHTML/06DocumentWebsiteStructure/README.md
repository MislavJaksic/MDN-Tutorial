## [Document and website structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)

### HTML for structuring content

Basic sections:
* `<header>`: a big strip across the top, contains common information about a website
* `<nav>`: navigation bar you link your website
* `<main>`: for content that is unique to this web page
    * has subsection elements `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<div>`
* `<aside>`: peripheral info, links, quotes; located inside `<main>`
* `<footer>`: across the bottom of the page; fine print, copyright notices, or contact info; may be used for SEO

### HTML layout elements in more detail

#### Non-semantic wrappers

`<div>` and `<span>` are non-semantic wrappers.  
Use them only when there is no other semantic element.  

#### Line breaks and horizontal rules

`<br>` is break line.  
`<hr>` is horizontal rule.
