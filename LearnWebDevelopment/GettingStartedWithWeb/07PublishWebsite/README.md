## [Publishing your website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Publishing_your_website)

### What are the options?

Methods:
* web hosting and domain
* platforms like `GitHub` or `Google App Engine`
* simulators like `CodePen`

#### Getting hosting and a domain name

To host your website you need to rent a web server.  
A web server is a virtual or physical machine that answers requests.  

Domain name is a unique address that points to your web server.  

#### Using an online tool like GitHub or Google App Engine

[GitHub](https://github.com/) and its [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allow you to host static, not-for-profit websites.  
[Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) runs your website on Google's infrastructure.  

#### Using a web-based IDE such as CodePen
