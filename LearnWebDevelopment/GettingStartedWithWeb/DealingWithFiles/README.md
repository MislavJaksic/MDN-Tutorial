## [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)

A website consists of files.  
File structure is important.  
Local and server file structure should be the same.  

### Where should your website live on your computer?

In a special directory.  

### An aside on casing and spacing

Write in lowercase.  
Instead of spaces use dashes.  

### What structure should your website have?

Create:
* `project-directory`
* `index.html`
* `images` directory
* `styles` directory
* `scripts` directory
