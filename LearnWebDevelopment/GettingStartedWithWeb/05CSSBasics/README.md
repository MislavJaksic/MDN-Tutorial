## [CSS basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)

CSS stands for `Cascading Style Sheets`.  

### So what is CSS?

CSS styles HTML `Element`s.  

#### Anatomy of a CSS ruleset

```
p, li, h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

The construct is called a ruleset.  
`p, li, h1` are selectors that select HTML `Element`s.  
`color: red;` is a declaration that styles an `Element`'s property.  
`color: red` is a property and property value.  

#### Different types of selectors

See the [MDN Selectors guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors).  

### Fonts and text

See `style.css`.  

### CSS: all about boxes

CSS layout is based on the box model.  

Each box has:
* padding: space around the content
* border: a solid line just outside the padding
* margin: space around the outside of the border

See `style.css`.
